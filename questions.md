**A4:**

There're 3 major locations to store the images, those are

- **Docker Hub** - It's a location that is run by Docker and can contain public and private repositories. We may only want to use Docker Hub when we're testing the containers.

- **Docker Trusted Registry** - It's a location that is also run by Docker but provides the ability to get support from Docker. We'll use this option when we're in a company that uptime is necessary.

- **The locally run Docker registry** - Locally run by ourself to storage images. We'll use this option when we're running containers that store some private data and want to keep the data locked.

**A5:**

We should use prototypes because we can analyze and ignore unimportant details easily and we also offer chances for correction to get away with incorrect results. Moreover, prototyping is much cheaper and faster to develop than full-scale production.
